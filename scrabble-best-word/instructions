----------------------------------------
You're playing to scrabble. But counting points is hard.

You decide to create a little script to calculate the best possible value.

The function takes two arguments :

points : an array of integer representing for each letters from A to Z the points that it pays
words : an array of strings, uppercase

You must return the index of the shortest word which realize the highest score.
When there are two or more words having same score, then the index of the smallest word should be returned

If also the length is the same, then return the index of the first one.
